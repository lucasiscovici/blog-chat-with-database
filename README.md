## Installation Instructions

To set up your environment and install all necessary dependencies for this project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Poetry**: If you don't have Poetry installed, you can install it following the instructions on the [Poetry website](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation).

2. **Install Dependencies**: Once Poetry is installed, run the following command in your terminal in the project's root directory:

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    This command will install all the dependencies listed in the `pyproject.toml` file, ensuring that your project has all the required packages and is ready to run.

## Usage

### Prerequisites:
- **OpenAI API Key**: You must have an OpenAI API key to use this code. You can obtain it from OpenAI's website.
- **GPT-4 Access**: Ensure you have access to GPT-4, which may require a payment method and prior payment for usage.

### Setting Up Your Environment
Before running the code, you need to set up your environment:

1. **Create a .env File**:
   In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env`. This file will store your OpenAI API key securely.

2. **Add Your OpenAI API Key**:
   Open the `.env` file in a text editor and add the following line:

   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-XXXXXXX
   ```

### Warning: Cost of Usage
Using OpenAI's GPT-4 incurs charges. The total cost for completing the tutorial as described in the blog is approximately â‚¬1. This is an estimate and actual costs may vary based on your usage.

### Running the Code
To execute the code, use the following command in your terminal:

```bash
poetry run main
```
